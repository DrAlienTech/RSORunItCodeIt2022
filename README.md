### Task Files
* ðŸš§ C++ - [tasks.cpp](./tasks.cpp)
* ðŸš§ Java - [tasks.java](./tasks.java)
* âœ… Python - [tasks.py](./tasks.py)

_**Disclaimer:** Although the C++ and Java files are currently empty, they should be completed very soon (this README will be updated once they are). In addition, documentation has not been added to the Python file, but it will be included in all three files once they are complete._

### Instructions

1. Open a code editor such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Collaboration functionality is recommended. You may use C++ 17, Java 8 or 17, or Python 3, including any subversions.
2. Create a file with a commented line near the top with your team number (B__).
3. Open [rici.app](https://rici.app/) in a separate tab and sign in with Google and note down what emails were used. Note that both participants may sign in but only one should submit a file at the end.
4. Enter the password "**high-voltage-coil**" and click **Start Test** to begin. Your access to the program ends 50 minutes after you click **Start Test**.
5. Code the entire program that runs in the terminal in a single file. You may use the internet or any other resources but may not copy code from the internet.
6. Click **Submit File** to submit a single source file once you are finished.

You may [contact us at any time](./README.md#Event-Supervisors) (contact information linked at the bottom) if you need assistance.

### Scoring Rubric

[RasmitDevkota's Run It Code It Scoring Rubric](https://gist.github.com/DrAlienTech/f97fa4f7a6649ba6dd92d5579251837e)

Points were allocated very generously based on completion of each step of the process, and partial points were awarded to teams who at least attempted each task, even if they didn't code it correctly. No points were awarded for portions which were not attempted at all.

### Reflection

he aim with this competition was to provide lots of opportunity for competitors to earn points from various tasks regardless of what they were skilled at, thus why there are 13 tasks. In addition, the tasks were meant to be of varying levels of difficulty (general increasing as you go down the list).

In terms of task difficulty, it was very clear that Task #2, "Pythagorean theorem calculator", was the easiest as most teams attempted it and all who attempted it coded the logic correctly. Many teams did attempt Task #3, "Parentheses balancer", but most did not realize the full technicalities of balancing parentheses, only counting the number of left and right parentheses. Task #6, "Leap year checker", was also commonly-attempted but quite a few teams were not fully aware of the full formula behind leap years. Overall, it was clear that most competitiors missed at least some points because they did not fully understand the logic of what they were attempting, so this may be something to improve upon in the future.

As feedback to competitors, remember that partial credit is always an opportunity! Many teams barely got past the menu, some only coded a single task and gave up afterwards. Even if you aren't sure about something, at least include it in the menu and parse the input and pass it to a bare function. Along with proper style, documentation, and modularity, this would earn enough points to improve a team's ranking by at least a few places.

### Feedback Survey

Feedback Survey: [scioly.web.app/feedback/rso2022-rici](https://scioly.web.app/feedback/rso2022-rici)

If you competed at this tournament, please consider completing our feedback survey if you have not already! If you did not compete, you are more than welcome to try this test out and fill out the survey afterwards! Constructive feedback helps more than you'd think, so we would really appreciate it if you could take a minute to compete the survey! Who knows, maybe you'll see us again at a future competition with an even better test!
